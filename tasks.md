# Response Time Over Time (RTOT) Chart - Implementation Tasks

## Project Overview

Building a React application with Vite + TypeScript that visualizes LLM response time data with a split-pane UI featuring file upload, interactive charts, and data tables.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Data Table**: MUI DataGrid
- **State Management**: React Context + Custom Hooks
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation

- [ ] 1.1 Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript project
- [ ] 1.2 Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- [ ] 1.3 Install core dependencies (Recharts, MUI DataGrid, react-dropzone)
- [ ] 1.4 Set up TypeScript configuration with path aliases
- [ ] 1.5 Configure Vite for path resolution
- [ ] 1.6 Set up basic project structure (components/, hooks/, context/, types/, utils/, **tests**/, data/)

### Phase 2: Type Definitions & Data Models

- [ ] 2.1 Create TypeScript interfaces for response data structure
- [ ] 2.2 Define context types for state management
- [ ] 2.3 Create sample data factory for testing
- [ ] 2.4 Define component prop types

### Phase 3: State Management & Custom Hooks

- [ ] 3.1 Create React Context for global state (file data, selected items, filters)
- [ ] 3.2 Implement custom hook for file upload logic
- [ ] 3.3 Implement custom hook for data transformation (chart data, table data)
- [ ] 3.4 Implement custom hook for chart-table synchronization
- [ ] 3.5 Implement custom hook for filtering logic

### Phase 4: Core Components

- [ ] 4.1 Create FileUpload component (drag-and-drop + manual selection)
- [ ] 4.2 Create ResponseTimeChart component (Recharts line chart)
- [ ] 4.3 Create DataTable component (MUI DataGrid)
- [ ] 4.4 Create FilterControls component
- [ ] 4.5 Create main App layout with split-pane design

### Phase 5: Data Transformation & Business Logic

- [ ] 5.1 Implement data parsing utilities for JSON files
- [ ] 5.2 Create chart data transformation functions
- [ ] 5.3 Implement table data formatting utilities
- [ ] 5.4 Create filtering and sorting utilities
- [ ] 5.5 Implement anomaly detection for chart markers

### Phase 6: Integration & Synchronization

- [ ] 6.1 Connect chart and table selection synchronization
- [ ] 6.2 Implement tooltip data display
- [ ] 6.3 Add visual feedback for file upload states
- [ ] 6.4 Implement responsive design adjustments
- [ ] 6.5 Add error handling and validation

### Phase 7: Testing Implementation

- [ ] 7.1 Set up Jest and React Testing Library configuration
- [ ] 7.2 Create test utilities and mock data factories
- [ ] 7.3 Write unit tests for custom hooks
- [ ] 7.4 Write component tests for presentational components
- [ ] 7.5 Write integration tests for chart-table synchronization
- [ ] 7.6 Write tests for data transformation utilities

### Phase 8: Polish & Documentation

- [ ] 8.1 Add comprehensive error boundaries
- [ ] 8.2 Implement loading states and skeleton components
- [ ] 8.3 Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] 8.4 Create comprehensive README with usage instructions
- [ ] 8.5 Add sample data files for demonstration
- [ ] 8.6 Performance optimization for large datasets

### Phase 9: Final Integration & Testing

- [ ] 9.1 End-to-end testing of complete user flow
- [ ] 9.2 Performance testing with large datasets (1000+ entries)
- [ ] 9.3 Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] 9.4 Mobile responsiveness verification
- [ ] 9.5 Final code review and cleanup

## Success Criteria

- [ ] File upload works with drag-and-drop and manual selection
- [ ] Chart displays response time data over time with proper scaling
- [ ] Table shows all data with sorting and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Chart and table selection are synchronized
- [ ] Application handles large datasets (1000+ entries) smoothly
- [ ] All components are properly tested with good coverage
- [ ] Code follows separation of concerns (hooks for logic, components for presentation)
- [ ] TypeScript types are comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] UI is responsive and accessible

## Notes

- Focus on clean separation between data transformation (hooks) and presentation (components)
- Ensure all business logic is testable through custom hooks
- Use TypeScript strictly for better maintainability
- Prioritize performance for large datasets
- Follow React best practices for state management and component design
